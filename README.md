Ian Noyes / Selenium Testing Suite
==================================

## Goals

The goal of this repo is to build a testing suite that will enable fast automated testing of Wordpress sites.  At the End of development this program should be able to ping a site, detect certain plugins, and run specific tests based upon those plugins.  This will be useful for users who host multiple Wordpress sites and don't have the time to manully test each one.  Eventually this project will be tied into a publicly available DockerHub image that will handle the dependencies for the selenium server.
